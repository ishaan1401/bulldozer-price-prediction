Bulldozer Price Prediction using Machine Learning


This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the prices of bulldozers. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using various machine learning algorithms and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to estimate the price of a bulldozer based on various parameters.

Introduction
Predicting the prices of bulldozers is crucial for the construction and heavy machinery industry. Accurate price predictions can assist buyers and sellers in making informed decisions. This project aims to leverage machine learning algorithms and techniques to predict the price of bulldozers based on a set of input features.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about various bulldozers, including attributes such as machine specifications, usage history, equipment type, and more. Each entry in the dataset includes these features along with the actual sale price of the bulldozer. The goal is to build a model that can predict bulldozer prices using these features.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before applying machine learning algorithms, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the dataset. EDA involved data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to understand the relationships between various features and the target variable (price). EDA helps in identifying trends, correlations, and potential outliers in the data.

Machine Learning Algorithms
Several machine learning algorithms were implemented in this project to build and compare predictive models. The algorithms used include:

Random Forest Classifier
Each algorithm was trained and evaluated using appropriate techniques, and hyperparameter tuning was performed to enhance their performance.

Results
The project's main objective is to predict the price of a bulldozer. The trained machine learning model provides a predicted price based on the input features provided. This prediction can be used to estimate the price of a bulldozer according to its specifications.
